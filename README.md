# Angular Material Templates

These Sass modules and stylesheet are an example of how to customize Angular Material in a project. These can be copied into any new project in order to get started faster.

Ideally the modules will be added to a `src/styles` directory, which would then be added to the `stylePreprocessorOptions` in `angular.json` (for both the `build` and `test` objects):

```json
{
  "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
    "includePaths": ["src/styles"]
  }
}
```
